# For Contributors

Please consult with your assigned editor before uploading your lesson to the ph-submissions repo to start the review process.

When submitting a lesson to the ph-submissions repo, please upload your Markdown file to the language folder (for example, ["en"](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/tree/gh-pages/en)), and put your draft in either the [Originals](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/tree/gh-pages/en/drafts/originals) or [Translations](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/tree/gh-pages/en/drafts/translations) directory.

You will separately upload your image files to the [images](https://github.com/programminghistorian/ph-submissions/tree/gh-pages/images) directory within a folder named the same slug as your lesson.
